#Creating Tkinter Window In Python:

from tkinter import *

new_window = Tk() #Create a window ; spaces should be denoted with underscores ; every window should have a different name
new_window.title("My Python Project") #Name of screen ; name should be the one which you already declared (new_window)
new_window.geometry("200x150") #Resizes the default window size
new_window.configure(bg = "red") #Gives color to the background

new_window.mainloop() #Shows the window on the screen
